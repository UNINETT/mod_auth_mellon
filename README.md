mod_auth_mellon
===============

As of Monday 30 September 2019, this project is no longer maintained
by Uninett.

A maintained fork of the project is available at:

  https://github.com/latchset/mod_auth_mellon

The original code is still available on the master branch at:

  https://github.com/Uninett/mod_auth_mellon/tree/master

A copy of the announcement we sent to the mailing list is available
below:

> Shutting down mod_auth_mellon
> -----------------------------
>
> Hi,
>
> as many of you may have noticed, Uninett has not been a very active
> contributor to mod_auth_mellon for several years â€“ neither helping
> users troubleshoot their configuration, nor fixing issues.
>
> We have discussed the situation internally and have concluded that we
> cannot continue maintaining this project going forwards. We are no
> longer really using mod_auth_mellon ourselves, so prioritizing
> spending time on this project is hard to justify for us.
>
> Instead of giving the impression that we are still maintaining the
> project while not spending the required time on it, we feel that it is
> better to make the situation clear and shut it down from our end.
>
> We do hope that if there is community interest, someone else will pick
> up the project, but that is something that the community will have to
> arrange by itself.
>
> I would like to thank everyone for their contributions to the project
> through the years, both for pull requests implementing fixes and
> features and for helping with issues and support requests.
>
> Lastly, a couple of practical matters:
>
> * The GitHub project has been updated to reflect the status of the
>   project and marked as archived, but the code is still available in
>   the master branch:
>
>     https://github.com/Uninett/mod_auth_mellon/tree/master
>
>   It should still be possible to fork and clone the repository but be
>   aware that you will have to manually do a checkout of the master
>   branch to get the actual code. If you fork it on GitHub, you will
>   have to change the default branch back to the master branch.
>
> * The mailing list will be shut down in a couple of weeks.
>
> Best regards,
